# Jules

Jules is a game-dev + ML-oriented language/runtime with:
- ECS + system runtime
- ML tensor engine (CPU + GPU hooks)
- C ABI for embedding in external engines

## Engine / Host Integrations

### C++
Use `bindings/cpp/jules.hpp` and link against the generated `libjules`.

### C# (Unity/Godot C#)
Use `bindings/csharp/Jules.cs` (`DllImport("jules")`) and ship the native library next to the game binary.

### Python
Use `bindings/python/jules.py` (ctypes wrapper) or build with `--features python` for PyO3 bindings.

## C ABI entry points

- `jules_run_file_ffi(const char* path)`
- `jules_check_code_ffi(const char* source)`
- tensor lifecycle + shape/data APIs
- physics sample APIs

## Experimental low-byte inference

Jules now includes an INT8 inference path for linear layers:
- `Tensor::quantize_linear_int8()` (offline weight quantization)
- `Tensor::linear_int8()` (inference with 1-byte weights + per-channel scales)
- `Int8LinearWeights::effective_bytes_per_param()` to estimate memory cost

This targets roughly **~1 byte/parameter** plus small scale overhead, for
running (inference) workloads.

## Faster CPU matmul path

`Tensor::matmul()` uses a cache-aware blocked kernel for larger matrices
(with existing multi-threading), while keeping the low-overhead unrolled kernel
for smaller shapes.

The CPU fallback in `gpu_backend.rs` now mirrors this strategy for `matmul`
as well (transpose + blocked kernel + threaded row chunks), following the same
core ideas used by high-performance JIT stacks: contiguous access, tiling, and
parallel work partitioning.

## Automated syntax fix flow

Use:

```bash
jules fix path/to/file.jules
```

`jules fix` applies safe automatic syntax fixes from parser diagnostics
(e.g. missing `;`, missing `)`, `]`, `}`, and common `fun`/`func` → `fn`
keyword typo recovery).

## Run a sample game script

```bash
cargo run --offline -- run small_game.jules
```
